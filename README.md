# Network-Security-_-Assignment
# DNS Vulnerabilities Demonstration Project

## Overview

This repository contains all the necessary materials and documentation for implementing and demonstrating two critical DNS security vulnerabilities:

1. DNS Zone Transfer vulnerability
2. DNS Cache Poisoning using Birthday Attack

This project is intended for educational purposes as part of the CSC1134 Network Security Assignment 2024-2025. The goal is to produce a 15-minute educational video demonstrating these vulnerabilities, their impact, and how to defend against them.

## Accelerated Implementation Process (10-Day Plan)

### Days 1-3: Environment Setup & Zone Transfer Attack

1. Set up GNS3 environment and network topology
2. Configure DNS servers with intentional vulnerabilities
3. Implement and document Zone Transfer attack

### Days 4-6: Cache Poisoning Attack

1. Develop and test the DNS Cache Poisoning script
2. Execute attack and demonstrate impact
3. Analyze and document attack procedures and outcomes

### Days 7-8: Security Countermeasures

1. Implement and test Zone Transfer defenses
2. Implement and test Cache Poisoning defenses
3. Document security countermeasures

### Days 9-10: Video Production

1. Finalize script and record demonstrations
2. Edit video and add explanatory elements
3. Produce and test final video

## Getting Started

1. Start by reviewing [requirements.md](requirements.md) and [proposal.md](proposal.md) to understand the project scope
2. Follow the network setup in [topology.md](topology.md)
3. Implement the environment using [setup_instructions.md](setup_instructions.md)
4. Execute the attacks following [dns_zone_transfer_attack.md](dns_zone_transfer_attack.md) and [dns_cache_poisoning_attack.md](dns_cache_poisoning_attack.md)
5. Implement defenses using [dns_security_countermeasures.md](dns_security_countermeasures.md)
6. Record and edit the video according to [video_script.md](video_script.md)
7. Follow the [implementation_timeline.md](implementation_timeline.md) to stay on track

## Daily Checkpoint Meetings

- 30-minute morning meeting to assign daily tasks
- 30-minute evening meeting to verify progress and address issues
- Continuous communication via team chat/collaboration tools

## Important Dates

- Accelerated Completion Deadline: [Set date 10 days from start]
- Assignment Submission Deadline: April 4, 2025

## Additional Notes

- All attack demonstrations must be performed in an isolated lab environment
- Video must be submitted in WebM or MP4 format, playable in VLC
- Include the Declaration of Academic Integrity with the submission

CSC1134 Network Security Assignment 2024-2025
Darragh O'Brien B.Sc. Ph.D. FHEA, School of Computing, Dublin City University
Overview
In this assignment your task is to select a vulnerability (or set of related vulnerabilities) and produce an educational video (with audio commentary) in which you explain the vulnerability before
demonstrating an exploit of the vulnerability.
Video contents
With a maximum duration of 15 minutes, your video must be structured as follows:
a) Brief introduction and outline of the video’s contents
b) Relevance of your demonstration i.e. how widespread/serious is the vulnerability?
c) Detailed explanation of the vulnerability (showing code where applicable)
d) Explanation of how the exploit functions
e) Description of security tools that can be used to detect and exploit the vulnerability
f) Demonstration of those security tools in the detection and exploitation of the vulnerability
g) Description of how to defend against the vulnerability
h) Summary and conclusions
Video recording
Tools such as recordmydesktop and Zoom can be used for screen and audio capture. Produce your
video in WebM or MP4 format. Prior to submission, verify your video can be played by VLC. (If I
cannot play your video in VLC it will not be marked so carry out some early testing of your recording approach.)
Deliverables
On behalf of the team, one team member must submit a single zip file containing the following:
 Your video in WebM or MP4 format, and,
 a completed Declaration of Academic Integrity (see Appendix I of the latter document) for
each of the assignment team members. Submissions that do not include a completed Declaration of Academic Integrity will not be marked.
How much of my overall module mark is this assignment worth?
It is worth 15% of your overall module mark.
Do I have to work in a team?
Yes. Only submissions by teams of three people will be accepted.
Plagiarism
All students must adhere to DCU's Academic Integrity and Plagiarism Policy. Each student must
complete and submit the Declaration of Academic Integrity contained in Appendix I of the latter
document. You should note that the following are breaches of academic integrity that will be dealt
with by the University's Disciplinary Committee:
 Sharing your work with anyone outside your group (intentionally or inadvertently)
 Posting your work on the Internet (either to request help or to share with others)
How to submit
Upload a single zip file containing all assignment deliverables to lockbox before the deadline. Note
there is a 150 MB upload limit so ensure your video does not cause you to exceed it.
Deadline
23:59 Friday 4 April 2025.
Late submissions
Late submissions will not be accepted.
Frequently asked questions
Q. I am not in a project team. What should I do?
A. E-mail me as soon as possible and I'll try to put you in touch with other students in the same position. Three weeks after the assignment has been posted any student not yet in a team will be assigned to a random one.
Q. I was sick during the period we had to work on the assignment. Can I get an extension?
A. Yes, as long as your request for an extension is accompanied by a medical cert covering the period in question.
Q. I was sick during the period we had to work on the assignment but I did not visit a doctor so
have no medical cert. Can I get an extension?
A. Any request for an extension not accompanied by a medical cert will be refused.
Q. Where is the machine I am exploiting?
A. It should be a virtual machine. It can be running in VMware Workstation or VirtualBox as a
guest on your host machine. It might be running as a Docker container inside GNS3.
Q. Do I have to use GNS3?
A. It is not mandatory, however, some credit will be given for doing so.
Q. Should I confirm with the module coordinator whether the vulnerability I have decided to
showcase is suitable?
A. Yes.
Q. Can I demonstrate the exploitation of more than one vulnerability?
A. Yes. A set of related vulnerabilities is fine.
Q. Can I demonstrate ARP spoofing?
A. No. I demonstrated this one during lectures. You must demonstrate independent learning.
Q. Can I demonstrate DHCP spoofing?
A. No. I demonstrated this one during lectures. You must demonstrate independent learning.
Q. Can I demonstrate a DoS attack?
A. I generally recommend against demonstrating DoS attacks, in particular, those that amount to
pointing to an unsurprising increase in CPU usage in the face of increased network traffic.
Q. Can I make use of Metasploit?
A. Yes. However you must compensate by providing a detailed description of the vulnerability and
how Metasploit is exploiting it.
Q. Can I make use of Metasploitable?
A. Yes. However you must compensate by providing a detailed description of the vulnerability and
how Metasploit is exploiting it.
Q. What file format should be used for the video?
A. WebM or MP4. Verify your video plays in VLC before submitting it.
Q. What if my video is in a format unrecognised by VLC?
A. It will not be marked.
Q. How long should the video last?
A. 15 minutes maximum.
Q. Where can I look for useful security tools?
A. You could try Kali Linux or Security Onion.
Q. Do I have to use the security tools above?
A. No. I merely mention Kali Linux and Security Onion because of the wide selection of potentially
useful security tools that come with them.
Q. Do I have to demonstrate just one security tool?
A. No. A set of related security tools is fine.
Q. Can I use any version of the security tool(s)?
A. Yes. Just mention which version(s) you are using.
Q. Can I exploit a vulnerability in an older version of some software?
A. Yes. Just mention which version(s) you are using, where you got it and how you configured it.
Q. Would scanning a machine with nmap suffice for this assignment?
A. No. Scan to reveal problems and then explain and exploit.
I have a different question
E-mail me well in advance of the deadline.

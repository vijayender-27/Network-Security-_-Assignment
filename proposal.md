We would like to propose a comprehensive demonstration combining two DNS vulnerabilities:

1. DNS Cache Poisoning using Birthday Attack:

- Implementation of the attack in GNS3 environment
- Demonstrating DNS query prediction and race conditions
- Using custom scripts for query flooding
- Analyzing attack patterns
- Showing successful cache manipulation
- This aligns with your suggestion regarding the Kaminsky attack approach

2. DNS Zone Transfer Vulnerability:

- Setting up and exploiting misconfigured BIND DNS server
- Demonstrating information gathering through zone transfers
- Using tools like dig and dnsenum
- Packet analysis of the transfer process
